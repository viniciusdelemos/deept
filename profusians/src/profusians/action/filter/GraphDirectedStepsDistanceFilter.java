/**
 * 
 * Filter Action for directed graphs. All items within a specified directed
 * graph distance from a set of focus items are set visible; all other items
 * will be set to invisible.
 * 
 * The distance is specified by the two parameters successorStepsDistance and
 * predecessorStepsDistance. Nodes which are set visible must be reachable from
 * a set of focus items by traversing at most successorStepsDistance times to a
 * successor of a node and at most predecessorStepsDistance times to predecessor
 * of a node.
 * 
 * By default, the successorStepsDistance and predecessorStepsDistance is set 1
 * and the {@link prefuse.Visualization#FOCUS_ITEMS} group will be used as the
 * source nodes from which to measure the distance.
