/**
 * 
 * Filter Action for directed graphs. All items within a specified directed
 * graph distance from a set of focus items are set visible; all other items
 * will be set to invisible.
 * 
 * The distance is specified by the two parameters successorSphereDistance and
 * predecessorSphereDistance. Nodes which are set visible must be reachable from
 * a set of focus items by the follwing traversing rules:
 * 
 * Within the graph distance specified by the successorSphereDistance parameter,
 * edges from a node to a successor can be traversed. (successor sphere) Within
 * the graph distance specified by the predecessorSphereDistance parameter,
 * edges from a node to a predecessor can be traversed. (predecessor sphere)
 * 
 * By default, the successorSphereDistance and predecessorSphereDistance is set
 * 1 and the {@link prefuse.Visualization#FOCUS_ITEMS} group will be used as the
 * source nodes from which to measure the distance.
